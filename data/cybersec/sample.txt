# Penetration Testing Guide

## Reconnaissance
Port scanning is the first step in penetration testing. Use nmap to discover open ports and services.
Common ports: 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS), 3389 (RDP), 3306 (MySQL).

## Vulnerability Assessment
After reconnaissance, identify vulnerabilities using tools like Nessus, OpenVAS, or Nikto.
Check for CVEs and known exploits in the discovered services.

## Exploitation
Metasploit framework provides exploits for many vulnerabilities.
Always obtain proper authorization before testing.
Document all findings for the final report.

## Post-Exploitation
Privilege escalation techniques: kernel exploits, misconfigured SUID binaries, weak credentials.
Lateral movement: pass-the-hash, pivoting through compromised systems.

## SQL Injection
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='admin' AND password='password'
UNION SELECT null, table_name FROM information_schema.tables--
Always use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.

## XSS Attacks
Cross-site scripting allows injecting malicious scripts into web pages.
<script>alert('XSS')</script>
Use Content-Security-Policy headers and input sanitization.

## Buffer Overflow
Stack-based buffer overflows exploit memory corruption.
Return-oriented programming (ROP) bypasses DEP protection.
ASLR randomizes memory addresses to make exploitation harder.
